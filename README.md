# @particle-academy/fancy-features

[![Fancy UI suite](art/fancy-ui.svg)](https://particle.academy)

Headless, **zero-dependency** feature-management engine — boolean flags +
metered-resource gating, feature **groups** (with `extends`, overrides, and
callable gates), and quota usage tracking. The Node/TypeScript mirror of the
PHP [`particle-academy/laravel-fms`](https://github.com/Particle-Academy/laravel-fms)
— same resolution semantics, no Laravel/Eloquent. It also **owns the shared
feature contract** consumed by
[`@particle-academy/fancy-catalog`](https://github.com/Particle-Academy/fancy-catalog-js).

```ts
import { createFeatures } from "@particle-academy/fancy-features";

const features = createFeatures({
  features: {
    "use-mcp": { type: "boolean", enabled: true },
    "ai-tokens": { type: "resource", limit: 10_000 },
  },
  groups: [
    { key: "pro-plan", features: ["use-mcp", "ai-tokens"], overrides: { "ai-tokens": { limit: 50_000 } } },
  ],
});

await features.canAccess("use-mcp", user); // true
await features.remaining("ai-tokens", user); // 10000 − usage

// Group assignment lifts the cap (MAX wins):
features.groupStore.assign(user, "pro-plan");
await features.remaining("ai-tokens", user); // 50000 − usage
```

## Resolution order

`pre-strategies → gate → registry → groups (OR) → config → sources → default deny`

- **pre-strategies** — `registerPreStrategy(name, (feature, subject, context) => boolean | null)`; first non-null wins (authoritative). `registerPreRemainingStrategy` is the `number | null` analog for `remaining()`.
- **gate** — an injected `gate(feature, subject, context) => boolean | null`; a boolean is authoritative (can deny even when later sources would allow).
- **registry / config** — programmatic + config-map feature definitions; `enabled`/`check` evaluated.
- **groups** — the subject's assigned groups (`GroupStore`) plus callable-gated groups, OR'd; group `overrides` raise resource limits (MAX wins).
- **sources** — `FeatureSource[]` resolve `FeatureGrant[]`; a grant with `enabled:true` turns the feature on. **This is where fancy-catalog plugs in.**
- **resource `remaining`** — `MAX(group/source limit, feature.limit) − UsageStore.getUsage`, clamped ≥0; `null` ⇒ unlimited.

## API

`createFeatures(opts)` / `new FeatureManager(opts)`:

- `canAccess(key, subject?, context?)` → `Promise<boolean>` (`isEnabled` / `hasFeature` are aliases)
- `remaining(key, subject?, context?)` → `Promise<number | null>` (`null` = unlimited)
- `enabled(subject?, context?)` → `Promise<string[]>` (all enabled keys)
- `explain(key, subject?, context?)` → `Promise<AccessResult>` (`{ allowed, source, remaining?, limit?, used? }`)
- `registerPreStrategy` / `registerPreRemainingStrategy`
- `registerSource(FeatureSource)` · `registerFeature(key, def)` · `registerGroup(group)`
- **Quota helpers**: `increment` · `decrement` · `tryConsume` (atomic) · `usageFor` · `resetPeriod`

**Registry** — `FeatureRegistry`: array | factory fn | class-with-`definition()`.

**Groups** — `FeatureGroupRegistry` (`resolvedFeatures`, `resolvedOverrides`, `groupsContaining`, 1-level `extends` with cycle detection) + `GroupStore` (in-memory `InMemoryGroupStore` default).

**Usage** — `UsageStore` (in-memory `InMemoryUsageStore` default).

**Guard** — `requireFeature(manager, keys, subject?)` (OR logic, throws `FeatureAccessDeniedError`) + `canAccessAny` predicate + `requireFeatureMiddleware` (generic `(req,res,next)`, no express dependency).

**Helpers** — `feature()`, `canAccessFeature()`, `hasFeature()`, `featureRemaining()`, `enabledFeatures()` bound to a default instance via `setDefaultFeatures` / `configureFeatures`.

### The shared contract

Exported verbatim from the barrel and mirrored structurally by fancy-catalog's
`./features` subpath: `FeatureType`, `Subject`, `BillingPeriod`, `FeatureGrant`,
`FeatureSource`, `UsageStore`, `AccessResult`, `Feature`, `FeatureGroup`. A
`FeatureSource` built in catalog is assignable here with **no build-time
dependency** between the two packages.

```ts
import { createCatalogFeatureSource } from "@particle-academy/fancy-catalog/features";

const features = createFeatures({
  sources: [createCatalogFeatureSource(catalog, { resolveSubscription })],
});
await features.canAccess("use-mcp", user); // resolves via the user's subscription's product features
```
